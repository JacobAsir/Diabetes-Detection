# Diabetes-Detection
Built a Diabetes Detection Model 🩺🤖

I'm excited to share a project where I developed machine learning models to detect diabetes. Here’s a brief overview:

Data Handling: 📊
➖ Imported necessary libraries and read the data.
➖ Plotted Glucose vs. Insulin scatter plots for visualization.
➖ Performed feature engineering and EDA, analyzing diabetes cases across BMI categories.

Model Development: 🛠️
➖ Built multiple models: SVM, XGBoost, and KNN to detect diabetes.

Patient Functionality:  👩‍⚕️
➖ Created a function for patients to enter their data and get real-time diabetes predictions.
